The optional-silence phone sil occupies 14.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 53.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies -0.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise -0.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,39.7,3)
