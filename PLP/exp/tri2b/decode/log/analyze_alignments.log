The optional-silence phone sil occupies 15.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 53.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies -1.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise -0.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,56.9,3)
